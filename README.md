# BootCampCodeRefactor
Homework 1 for Bootcamp

In  this project I was tasked with refactoring code to optimize the code to fit SEO guidelines and improve the semantic structure of the code.

Fixes Made:

- I refactored the div tags to different tags like main, section, aside, etc.
- Fixed Redirect to SEO section by changing class to id
- Adding descriptions to each element of the page to make in code navigation much easier
- Changed title to a more descriptive one for the page
